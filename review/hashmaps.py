# DICTIONARIES

# Dictionary = map = data structure with key-value pairs.
# An array is a list-based structure whereas a map is a set-based structure.
# In a dictionary/map, a group of keys is a set. A set is unordered.
# The keys in a map has to be unique. Sets do not allow repeated elements!

# Example: get n maximum elements from dictionary
a = {'a':100, 'b':40, 'c':66, 'd':77, 'e':99, 'f':33}
b = sorted(a, key=a.get, reverse=True) ##reverse=True for descending, False for ascending order
max_dict = {}

# Remember that b is ONLY ['a', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'f'] at this point. (without values)

# For 3 maximum entries.
for key in b[:3]:
    print(key)
    max_dict[key] = a[key]
    
print(max_dict)

# LISTS INDEXING & SLICING

a = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
start = 0
end = len(a) - 1
step = 1 # by default

a[start:end] # items start through end-1
a[start:] # items start through the rest of the array
a[:end] # items form the beginning through end-1
a[:] # a copy of the whole array

a[start:end:step] # start through not past end, by step

a[-1] # last item in the array
a[-2:] # last two items in the array (-2, -1) +1
a[:-2] # everything except the last two items (-5, -4, -3) +1

a[::-1] # all items in the array, reversed (-1, -2, -3, -4, -5) -1
a[1::-1] # the first two items, reversed (1, 0) -1
a[:-3:-1] # the last two items, reversed (-1, -2) -1
a[-3::-1] # everything except the last two items, reversed (-3, -4, -5) -1

b = ["a"]
b[:-2] # we will get a empty list instead of an error

# HASHING
    
# Hashing is very important, because lookup time is constant O(1)
# Hash functions might get asked, there may be multiple hash functions that
# work as desired for your case. Communicate with the interviewer, ask questions, etc.
# Regarding collisions, 1) you can change the hash value, 2) you can add buckets to each hash
# key so that each unique key basically has a list, 3) or you can add a second, new hash function.

# When talking about hash tables, we have 'load factor':
# Load Factor = Number of Entries / Number of Buckets

# APPLICATION OF LOAD FACTOR
# The purpose of a load factor is to give us a sense of how "full" a hash table is. 
# For example, if we're trying to store 10 values in a hash table with 1000 buckets, 
# the load factor would be 0.01, and the majority of buckets in the table will be empty. 
# We end up wasting memory by having so many empty buckets, so we may want to rehash, 
# or come up with a new hash function with less buckets. 

# We can use our load factor as an indicator for when to rehashâ€”as the load factor 
# approaches 0, the more empty, or sparse, our hash table is. 
# On the flip side, the closer our load factor is to 1 
# (meaning the number of values equals the number of buckets), 
# the better it would be for us to rehash and add more buckets. 
# Any table with a load value greater than 1 is guaranteed to have collisions. (IMPORTANT)

# If you have a hash function that divides a group of values by 100, and uses the remainder
# as a key, and if there are 100 numbers that are all multiples of 5; then the load is:
# For the load factor, you should divide the number of values by the number of buckets. 

# There are 100 values, as stated in the question, and 100 buckets (0 to 99). 
# Thus, 100/100 = 1 (CORRECT ANSWER)

# The answer to the second part is 107 (to speed up the algorithm). 
# The other values all had something wrong with them:
# 1) 125 is also a multiple of 5. Dividing a bunch of multiples of 5 by 
# another multiple of 5 will cause a lot of collisions. 
# Here's an example, where 10 is used as the divisor:
# 5 % 10 = 5
# 10 % 10 = 0
# 15 % 10 = 5
# 20 % 10 = 0

# 2) 87 is better than 125, but because it's less than 100 it'll still have collisions. (guarenteed in fact)

# 3) 1001 is good, but it'll create a ton of leftover buckets and waste a lot of memory.
    
# HASHMAPS
    
# A Python dictionary is a hash map! Constant time lookup!
