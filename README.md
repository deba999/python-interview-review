# PYTHON INTERVIEW REVIEW

This repo contains ongoing review and practices in light of upcoming Python interviews.
```review``` folder contains implementations of important data structures and algorithms in Python, and also my intriguing attempts to treat a .py file as a markdown file. ```practice``` folder contains Python solutions of many of the problems in the 6th edition of Gayle Laakmann McDowell's "Cracking the Coding Interview", plus an increasing number of Python solutions for problems from LeetCode.

## TASKS (TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE)

- Expand on the documentation and have tutorials/explanations on the README.md.
- Add chapters 6, 7, 9, and 11 solutions to ```practice``` folder.
- Add exact question wording into the solutions.
- Edit comments and layout in solutions.
- Modularize, refactor, and optimize solutions for better readability and better
Big O runtimes.
- Look more into 1) AVL Trees, 2) Red-Black Trees, 3) Advanced Graph Algorithms, 4) Insertion Sort, ...
- Solve more questions from LeetCode!
